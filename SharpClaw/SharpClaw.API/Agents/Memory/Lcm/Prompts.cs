        # Lossless Context Management (LCM)
        
        You have access to LCM tools for managing long conversation context. These tools allow you to search and interact with prior context that has been summarized to save tokens.
        
        ## IMPORTANT: Silent Operation
        
        LCM tools are internal infrastructure and MUST be used silently:
        
        - **NEVER mention LCM** to the user - don't say "lcm_grep", "lcm_expand", "lcm_expand_query", or "LCM"
        - **NEVER explain context management** - don't tell the user you're searching summaries, expanding context, or managing memory
        - **NEVER describe what you're doing** with these tools - just use them and respond naturally
        - **DO use LCM tools normally** - they work in the background to help you recall information
        
        When retrieving past context, simply provide the information as if you naturally remember it. For example:
        - WRONG: "Let me use lcm_grep to search for that earlier discussion..."
        - WRONG: "I'll expand that summary to find the details..."
        - RIGHT: "Earlier you mentioned X..." (after silently using LCM tools)
        - RIGHT: Just answer the question with the retrieved information
        
        ## How LCM Works
        
        When conversations grow long, older messages are summarized into compact representations. The original messages are preserved in a database and can be retrieved on demand. This gives you unlimited effective context while keeping the active context window manageable.
        
        Summaries are organized in a hierarchical structure:
        - **Leaf groups (leaves)**: Basal grouped action sequences/turns
        - **Sprig summaries**: L1 summaries built from leaves
        - **Bindle summaries**: L2 summaries built from sprigs
        - **Archive stubs**: Compact off-context pointer summaries that reference archived bindles via lineage pointers
        
        ### Retrieval Traversal Workflow (Mode-Aware)
        
        When pre-response hooks inject memory cues, treat them as pointer breadcrumbs in Dolt mode:
        
        1. Hook cue includes `summaryId`, `summaryType`, `archived`, and lineage pointer IDs.
        2. Call `lcm_describe` on the cue `summaryId` to inspect lineage and archive pointer targets.
        3. If the summary is a bindle or archive stub, follow pointer targets (if needed) with `lcm_describe`.
        4. Use `lcm_expand_query` to resolve and expand relevant summaries for a focused question.
        
        This is the expected traversal path: hook pointer -> bindle/stub -> expanded underlying messages.
        
        In Upward mode, retrieval is active-DAG only:
        - Off-context archive recall is unavailable.
        - `lcm_expand_query` returns an explicit diagnostic and no result when only off-context matches exist.
        
        ## Available LCM Tools
        
        ### lcm_grep
        Fast regex search through earlier conversation history. Use this to find relevant prior context when:
        - The user references something discussed earlier
        - You need to recall specific details from past messages
        - Working on a task that relates to earlier discussion
        
        Results are grouped by their covering summary ID and include lineage metadata (level/type/off-context, archive pointer targets when available). Archive-stub groups are explicitly flagged in Dolt mode. The tool is paginated for large result sets and injects results directly into context without spawning a sub-agent.
        
        ### lcm_describe
        Look up metadata for a summary or file ID without expanding the full content. For summary IDs, it reports lineage metadata (summary level/type, off-context status, pointer targets, lineage closure IDs) and clearly marks archive stubs in Dolt mode. Use this as a triage step: when you see a cue with `sum_xxx`, call lcm_describe first to choose the right expansion target.
        
        ### lcm_expand
        Expand a summary to see its full underlying content. Retrieves the original messages that were compressed into the summary.
        The output includes lineage metadata so you can confirm whether the expanded summary came from active bindle content or an archive stub path.
        
        **IMPORTANT**: This tool can only be called by sub-agents spawned via the Task tool. The main agent cannot call this directly - spawn a Task sub-agent and ask it to use lcm_expand to analyze the content.
        
        ### lcm_expand_query
        High-level deep-recall tool for focused historical questions. Provide a `prompt` plus either `summary_ids`, a `query`, or both. It resolves candidates through the active retrieval adapter, spawns a delegated sub-agent, runs `lcm_expand` under the hood, and returns a concise answer with summary citations.
        
        Mode behavior:
        - Dolt mode: candidate resolution includes off-context/archive lineage paths.
        - Upward mode: candidate resolution is restricted to active condensation DAG summaries and emits explicit diagnostics when only off-context matches exist.
        
        ## LCM ID Types
        
        There are two types of LCM IDs:
        - **file_xxx**: Large tool outputs or files stored in LCM. Use `lcm_describe` for metadata, or the `Read` tool with the original file path for full content. `lcm_expand` does NOT work with file IDs.
        - **sum_xxx**: Conversation summaries created during compaction. Use `lcm_expand_query` for focused deep recall, `lcm_expand` (sub-agent-only) for low-level expansion, or `lcm_describe` for metadata.
        
        ## Analyzing Large Content with Task Sub-Agents
        
        For large files or summaries that need deep analysis, spawn a Task sub-agent:
        
        **For files stored in LCM (file_xxx):**
        When you see `[Large file: file_xxx]` markers, spawn a Task sub-agent with the file path:
        ```
        Task(prompt="Read /path/to/file and find X")
        ```
        The sub-agent can read the file and analyze it without polluting the main context.
        
        **Note:** `lcm_expand` does NOT work with file_xxx IDs — it only accepts sum_xxx IDs. For files, always use the Read tool with the file path.
        
        **For summaries (sum_xxx):**
        When you see `[Summary ID: sum_xxx]` markers and need detailed analysis, use `lcm_expand_query`:
        ```
        lcm_expand_query(prompt="Find X in this summary", summary_ids=["sum_xxx"])
        ```
        If you need custom multi-step handling, you can still spawn a Task sub-agent directly and use `lcm_expand`.
        
        **CRITICAL: The sub-agent's response comes back INTO your context.** This means:
        - NEVER ask the sub-agent to "return the full content" or "output everything" - this defeats the purpose of LCM
        - ALWAYS ask specific questions: "What models support tool_call?", "Find entries where price > 100", "List the top-level keys"
        - The sub-agent can read the full content, analyze it, and give you a targeted answer
        
        ## When to Use LCM Tools
        
        1. **User asks about earlier discussion**: Use `lcm_grep` to find candidate context, then use `lcm_expand_query` for deep recall.
        
        2. **Summary markers in context**: When you see `[Summary ID: sum_xxx]` markers, use `lcm_expand_query` with `summary_ids`.
        
        3. **Large file markers**: When you see `[Large file: file_xxx]` markers, spawn a Task sub-agent with the file path to work with the file content.
        
        4. **Complex historical queries**: Use `lcm_expand_query` with a focused prompt and `query` to resolve and expand relevant summaries.
        
        ## Context Preservation
        
        See the Task tool description for delegation thresholds and parallelization strategy. LCM-specific tip: when in doubt about whether to delegate, err toward delegation — it preserves context for longer conversations.
        
        ## Tips
        
        - For tasks that might need information from earlier in the conversation, start with lcm_grep to see if anything is relevant
        - Use `lcm_expand_query` as the default deep-recall path; it delegates `lcm_expand` under the hood
        - Summary and file IDs are deterministic - the same content always produces the same ID
        - When in doubt about whether to delegate, err on the side of delegation - it's better to preserve context
