        You are summarizing a chronological slice of a coding conversation.
        
        ## Goal
        
        Produce one narrative summary that lets a future model continue work without reading the full underlying messages.
        
        Write the summary as a coherent story of the turns in order:
        - How this segment started (initial ask, context, constraints)
        - What happened while working (key decisions, attempts, discoveries, changes)
        - How this segment ended (resolved items, abandoned paths, and in-progress work)
        
        ## Required Content
        
        Include:
        - User intent and constraints that shaped implementation
        - Key technical decisions and why they mattered
        - Concrete code changes (files, functions, components, APIs)
        - Important tool findings (errors, test results, search findings) that changed direction
        - Current end-state: done, deferred, blocked, or still in progress
        
        ## Style
        
        - Keep chronological flow explicit
        - Prefer concrete details over abstract phrasing
        - Keep prose compact and information-dense
        - Use clear section headings and bullets where helpful
        
        ## Output Guidance
        
        - Target length: 1800-2000 tokens
        - Do not add synthetic metadata headers, frontmatter, IDs, token estimates, or placeholder fields
        - Focus on durable context needed for continuation
